# Introduction to Residual Networks (ResNet)
Residual Networks, commonly known as ResNet, are a type of deep neural network that introduced a groundbreaking architecture to address the vanishing gradient problem, which often hampers the training of very deep networks. Developed by researchers at Microsoft Research in 2015, ResNet won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) that year, setting new benchmarks in image recognition.
# Key Concepts of ResNet
Residual Learning: The core idea behind ResNet is the use of residual blocks. Instead of learning the underlying mapping directly, the network learns the residual mapping. This means the network fits a function ( F(x) = H(x) - x ), where ( H(x) ) is the desired mapping. The original function can then be expressed as ( H(x) = F(x) + x ).
Skip Connections: These are identity shortcuts that skip one or more layers. They help in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem by allowing gradients to flow directly through the network, making it easier to train very deep networks.
Deep Architectures: ResNet architectures can have hundreds or even thousands of layers, thanks to the stability provided by residual learning and skip connections
# Why ResNet?
Improved Training: By using residual blocks, ResNet allows for the training of much deeper networks without suffering from the degradation problem, where adding more layers leads to higher training error.
State-of-the-Art Performance: ResNet has achieved state-of-the-art results in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
Versatility: The architecture of ResNet has been adapted and extended to various other domains and tasks, making it a versatile tool in the deep learning toolkit.
# Example Architecture
A typical ResNet architecture starts with a convolutional layer followed by several residual blocks. Each residual block contains two or more convolutional layers with skip connections. The network ends with fully connected layers for classification.

# U-Net: Biomedical Image Segmentation
Welcome to the U-Net project! This repository demonstrates the implementation and application of U-Net, a powerful deep learning architecture designed for image segmentation tasks, particularly in the biomedical field.
Introduction
U-Net is a fully convolutional neural network introduced by Olaf Ronneberger and his team in 2015. It was specifically developed for biomedical image segmentation, addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in the medical field. U-Netâ€™s architecture is designed to work effectively with small datasets, making it a popular choice for various image segmentation tasks.

The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. This design allows the network to learn from fewer training samples while achieving high accuracy.

Key features of U-Net include:

Skip Connections: These connections between corresponding layers in the contracting and expanding paths help retain spatial information, improving segmentation accuracy.
Data Augmentation: U-Net can be trained with extensive data augmentation, enhancing its robustness and generalization capabilities.
Versatility: While originally designed for biomedical applications, U-Net has been successfully applied to various other domains, including satellite imagery and autonomous driving.

# CIFAR-10 Image Colorization using UNET
Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Image Colorization project! This repository showcases a deep learning approach to colorize grayscale images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a ResNet-18 model.

# Introduction
Image colorization is a fascinating task in computer vision that involves adding color to grayscale images. In this project, we leverage the power of deep learning and the ResNet-18 architecture to predict and restore the colors of black-and-white images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes. For this project, we first convert the original RGB images to grayscale. Then, we use a pre-trained ResNet-18 model to predict the color information and reconstruct the colorized images.
# Key Features
Grayscale Conversion: Convert CIFAR-10 images to grayscale as the input for the model.
ResNet-18 Architecture: Utilize the ResNet-18 model, known for its residual learning capabilities, to predict the color of grayscale images.
Colorization: Automatically colorize grayscale images, restoring them to their original vibrant colors.
